/**
 * The order a mutant's test files run in: a file that failed when the worker
 * last ran it first, as vitest has it, then the quickest first, where vitest
 * runs the longest first.
 *
 * Stryker gives a mutant the files of the tests that cover it, every file for
 * a static mutant, runs them one after another in one worker and stops at the
 * first test that fails. Vitest's order suits a run that reports every failure
 * and wants its long files started early. Here the long files are
 * `tests/markdown/linear.test.ts`, `tests/pattern/oracle.test.ts` and
 * `tests/markdown/properties.test.ts`, four fifths of the suite's time between
 * them, and in vitest's order they were the first to fail for one killed
 * mutant in twenty. In five sweeps of one source, one killed mutant in
 * twenty-five had run other files to their end before the file that killed
 * it, a long one among them for two in three of those the reports can tell; a
 * static mutant that the first test of `tests/path.test.ts` kills, a file of
 * milliseconds, had run 827 tests before it; and a mutant killed late is one
 * that can run out its clock first: 31 mutants were killed in one of those
 * sweeps and timed out in another (ADR-0007, 2026-10-11).
 *
 * No test leaves the run and none is added: a mutant survives when every file
 * has passed, in any order. The first sweep in this order read 96.34% over the
 * same 5,546 mutants, with no survivor the five before it had not had and 30
 * of those 31 killed, and its six jobs took 27m30s where theirs had taken
 * 31m28s to 36m40s.
 *
 * A file with no time yet has none to go by, and its size is no guide to one
 * here: the seven largest files are unit tests that take about a second
 * between them and are the first to fail for three killed mutants in four,
 * and none of the three long ones is among the ten largest. It runs after the
 * files that have a time, the larger first, as vitest has it, and has a time
 * from then on.

 * mutation-shards.test.ts tests the CI script that splits the sweep and
 * merges it back, and the order above. It reaches nothing under src/, so it
 * cannot kill a mutant, and every static mutant runs the whole suite.
 * mutation-unmeasured.test.ts tests the count of what a sweep does not read.
 * It runs nothing under src/ either: it reads the sources as text, which in
 * Stryker's sandbox carry every mutant at once, and loads Stryker's
 * instrumenter, which every static mutant that survives would wait for. A
 * test holds the rest of this file to vitest.config.ts.
